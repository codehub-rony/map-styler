## MapStyler

A web application for designing vector data styles and interactive webmaps based on the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/). Simply add your data, customize the styling to your preferences and export it as a JSON file.

Visit [MapStyler](https://mapstyler.com) and try it. For more information on the how, what and why behind MapStyler, see my blogpost [Launching MapStyler](https://www.oneprojectatatime.nl/launching-mapstyler/).

#### Current features:

- Support for various datasources:
  - geoJSON files
  - [OGC API Vectortile](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-tiles) in WebMercator projection (beta)
- Basic styling for point, line and polygon features
- Create new layers using data filters
- Style layers
- export style as [Maplibre style JSON](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/)

#### Roadmap

The tool is in development and many more features are to come:

- Add support for [Maptiler GeoJSON layers](https://docs.maptiler.com/sdk-js/examples/geojson-polygon/) as data source
- Add option to export a basemap layer

Suggestions and ideas for futher development are welcome.
