## MapStyler

A web application for designing vector data styles and interactive webmaps based on the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/). Simply add your data, customize the styling to your preferences and export it as a JSON file. 

Visit [MapStyler](https://mapstyler.com) and try it. For more information on the how, what and why behind MapStyler, see my blogpost [Launching MapStyler](https://www.oneprojectatatime.nl/launching-mapstyler/).
